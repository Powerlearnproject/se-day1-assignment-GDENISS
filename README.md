Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Ans: software engineering is the process of writing instructions inform of code to computers , inorder to create useful tools such as apps, games and websites that allow for problem solving in the real world using technology.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Ans: evoution of computers. the dawn of computers ushered the begining of software enginering as they would be programmed to carry out specific task effeectively
     Internet : the internet allowed communication between different computers within a network, leading to more collaboration in the areas of softeare engineering.
     Evolution of AI: the arrival of ai has led to significant development of software engineering including the arrival of agentic ai that work more effectively to achieve an intended task

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Ans:1. Requirements and Specifications: involves the sponsors, users and developers of the software product.It leads to clearly defined goals, functionality and the constraints of operation of the product.
    2.Design: involves the generation of a design document that serves as a blue print for the proposed system.involves the adaptors and developers it allows for definition of pre and post conditions of all the functionality.  
    3. Implementation: Involves building the system described in the design. It involves the actual writing of the code to render the intended results.
    5. Testing: Refers to the process of detecting as many defects in the sofware system as possible, mainly unit testing and intergration.
    6. Adaptation: This is the process of maintenance and evolution of the completed system.
    
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Ans: watefall method describes development method that is linear and sequential.It has distinct goals for each phase of development. once a stage is completed there is no going back.
       Example:  Building a compliance system for a bank, where requirements are well-defined and changes are costly
        Agile method: involves interactive and incremental way of delivering a system where deliverly is of small functional  pieces of the software in iterations, allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation.
      Example: A mobile app  where user feedback drives feature adjustments.
       

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Ans: Software Developer, writes, debugs and maintains code.
     Quality Assuarance Engineer: Tests applications to identify bugs and defects and ensures they are upto the set standards
     Project Manager: He or she defines the scope, goals and deliverbles of the project. Also provides the required resources for the achievement of the project.
     
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Ans: Ide's provide tools for writing, debuggind and testing code in a single interface.
  Example: Pycharm.
     VCS: They allow for collaboration on projects by different developers, keep track on changes and manage various code versions.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Communication Gap:Encourage open communication channels and use collaboration tools
Skills Gap: Invest in training and  programming
Time management:Prioritize tasks and use project management tools to stay on schedule


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Ans: Unit Testing: Tests individual components or modules to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
Integration Testing: Tests the interaction between integrated modules to ensure they work together.
System Testing: Tests the complete and integrated software system to verify it meets specified requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Validates the end-to-end business process to ensure the system meets business requirements and is ready for delivery.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Ans: It is the process of giving instruction to AI to ensure, that its feedback gives optimised results that are most relevant to the request or the issue needed.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Ans: Vague Prompt: Tell me about the weather
     Improved Prompt: What is the current weather forecast for Nairobi, including temperature and chance of rain?
